# Blood-Disease-Classification
Description
Blood-Disease-Classification is a machine learning project aimed at classifying blood diseases. The project uses supervised learning, more specifically, it has been implemented using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called Blood Cell Images (Dataset) which was created by Kaggle user janowww. This dataset contains 4 folders with images of white blood cells: eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and neutrophil.

Setup
To run the project, please ensure that you have the following packages installed on your system:

Tensorflow
Keras
Numpy
Matplotlib
Pandas
Usage
Once you have the above packages installed, open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run through the cells to train and test the model. Make sure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook.

Credits
This project was completed as part of the requirements for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity.
